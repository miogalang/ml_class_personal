ON the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, I was in a hotel in Toronto. The morning paper had a reprint of a Chicago Tribune interview, run that Sunday, with Bill Ayers, a member of the radical Weather Underground in the 1960s. The Weathermen were an offshoot of Students for a Democratic Society. They and affiliated and like-minded groups engaged in
THOUGH she isn&rsquo;t read much anymore, Edna Ferber in the 1930s, &rsquo;40s and &rsquo;50s was a writer hard to ignore. She collaborated with George S. Kaufman on several plays, &ldquo;The Royal Family&rdquo; among them; she wrote almost a dozen best-selling novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning &ldquo;So Big&rdquo;; and she was an
SOMETIME in the early 2000s the composer Damon Intrabartolo enrolled himself in a camp for self-described ex-gay Christians as a kind of agent provocateur. With the pretense of seeking to cure his homosexuality, he intended to suss out, and possibly lightly sabotage, the program. When a young seeker privately confessed his doubts about the camp,
LOS ANGELES THE set of a Judd Apatow movie can sometimes feel like a day care center for children and adults alike. On an August day in 2011, Mr. Apatow, the writer, director and baby sitter in chief on comedies like &ldquo;Knocked Up,&rdquo; was preparing at a Brentwood mansion to shoot his new film, &ldquo;This Is 40.&rdquo; While his wife, the
THE book &ldquo;Life of Pi,&rdquo; a contemplative story about a boy lost at sea with a tiger companion, is not the most obvious candidate for a film. There&rsquo;s that tiger, for starters. But when Ang Lee set out to adapt Yann Martel&rsquo;s acclaimed novel , he conceived an intricate plan for extensive visual effects. That plan involved
SARAH BURNS is fine with not being the most prominent name associated with &ldquo;The Central Park Five,&rdquo; a new film, opening Nov. 23 in New York, about the wrongful convictions in the 1989 rape and beating of a white jogger in Central Park. Ms. Burns, 30, shares the credits for writing, directing and producing the documentary with another
NORMAN BATES and his mother were pretty effective at eliminating motel guests. But it was Alma Reville who really killed off Janet Leigh in the shower scene of &ldquo;Psycho.&rdquo; &ldquo;They were watching a cut of the film,&rdquo; the actor and producer Norman Lloyd recalled, referring to Ms. Reville and her husband, Alfred Hitchcock .
MARION COTILLARD was barefaced and sleepy eyed. &quot;I just woke up,&rdquo; she said, and did not quite stifle a yawn as she ordered room-temperature still water in a restaurant across from Central Park. Dressed in pale-gray jeans, hands with chipped navy-blue-painted nails the only evidence of her otherwise cashmere-swaddled upper body, this
Rags to Riches With Pickford When Mary Pickford donated her personal collection of films to the Library of Congress in 1946, she did so with the provision that they not be screened publicly. &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Sweetheart,&rdquo; as an exhibitor proclaimed her early in her extraordinary career, had been out of the spotlight for over a decade,
SIX years ago, when BOB DYLAN played the first New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival after Hurricane Katrina, his set list pointedly featured &ldquo;High Water (For Charley Patton),&rdquo; a harrowingly vivid portrait of flooding, death and exodus. As is often the case, he was working as much with myth as reality, but that didn&rsquo;t lessen
WHEN I was 12 or so and a serious piano student, I bought an LP recording of Arthur Rubinstein playing Chopin&rsquo;s four ballades. Though at the time I didn&rsquo;t know much about these works, I already loved Chopin and had had a recent triumph as a sixth grader performing his &ldquo;Grande Valse Brillante&rdquo; in E flat (with lots of
ON a Saturday afternoon last month a crowd packed into a studio on an industrial block in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to see the electronic dance music ensemble the Crystal Ark Party Machine. As a D.J. played acid-house tracks, two female singers wearing purple-and-white tie-dyed robes and starfish tiaras shook gourds and spun around like dervishes,
STARTING a series is hard. Just ask the producers of &ldquo;Made in Jersey.&rdquo; So it helps to have an indelible character to keep viewers entertained long enough to get them invested in stories they don&rsquo;t know and actors they&rsquo;ve often never seen. The most memorable scene stealers in this fall&rsquo;s new series largely carry on the
Lucille Bliss, who provided the cute, husky voice for the title character in the groundbreaking television cartoon series &ldquo;Crusader Rabbit&rdquo; in 1949, and later for Smurfette on the 1980s series &ldquo;The Smurfs,&rdquo; died on Nov. 8 in Costa Mesa, Calif. She was 96. David Scheve, a producer-director for TDA Animation who had worked
&ldquo;I CALL it the Zen bell,&rdquo; the photographer Joel Meyerowitz was saying recently, sitting in the sunshine in his Upper West Side apartment and studio, describing a nagging compulsion to begin a long-term project about banks in the wake of the Great Recession. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting any ding from anywhere else right now, and I keep
HOW&rsquo;S this for a surprising success story? In 2007 Katie Smythe, a ballet teacher working out of her native Memphis, was driving her most remarkable student, Charles Riley, across the Mississippi to a lecture-demonstration in Arkansas. Mr. Riley, a young man specializing in the local form of virtuoso hip-hop footwork known as jookin, had
THE ANGEL ESMERALDA: Stories , by Don DeLillo. (Scribner, $15.) DeLillo&rsquo;s first collection of short fiction, written between 1979 and 2011, offers telling insights into his fascination with the uneasy margins of contemporary life. In the 1994 title story, an aging nun in the South Bronx is swept up in a crowd that gathers around a billboard,
When Jimmy Lee Gray was sent to the Mississippi gas chamber in 1983 the procedure went horribly wrong. He gasped for breath and convulsed wildly, slamming his head against a metal pole hard enough to shake the room. The episode caused widespread revulsion, and Mississippi eventually switched from gas to lethal injection. Weeks after the botched
&ldquo;Which comes first, the stir-fry or the wok?&rdquo; It may sound like a bad joke, but the answer holds the key to one of the world&rsquo;s great cuisines. Bee Wilson&rsquo;s supple, sometimes playful style in &ldquo;Consider the Fork,&rdquo; a history of the tools and techniques humans have invented to feed themselves, cleverly disguises her
The next time you land at Logan Airport in Boston, pause a moment to reflect that you are standing on landfill annexed to what was once Noddle&rsquo;s Island. Here, sometime in the late 1840s, a young escapee from the Irish potato famine named Patrick Kennedy first set foot in the New World. A cooper by trade, Patrick died of cholera in 1858 at age
With the holidays approaching, the population density of many home kitchens will be increasing &mdash; and so will the stress level, for novice cooks and for more experienced hosts and hostesses coping, as Sam Sifton puts it in THANKSGIVING: How to Cook It Well (Random House, $18) , with a day of &ldquo;crowded dinner tables, of people arriving
Class hurts. Its injuries &mdash; as small as a paper cut, or as large as the difference between the 99 and the 1 percent &mdash; carry with them an exponential degree of shame. One often hears that we in the United States are in denial about class, but it might be more accurate to say that we maintain a tight-lipped silence about differences we
The author of &ldquo;Holidays in Heck&rdquo; and &ldquo;Parliament of Whores&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t like to read books about current affairs: &ldquo;I can write that junk myself.&rdquo; What book is on your night stand now? &ldquo;Kearny&rsquo;s March,&rdquo; by Winston Groom. The author of &ldquo;Forrest Gump&rdquo; has become a wonderful military
To the Editor: Bill Scheft, in reviewing Steven Rinella&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meat Eater: Adventures From the Life of an American Hunter&rdquo; (Nov. 4), felt the need to hold his nose and set aside his &ldquo;disdain toward hunters and hunting.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m wondering if Scheft feels the same disdain about eating factory-produced meat from chickens
To the Editor: John Jeremiah Sullivan&rsquo;s thoughtful review of Nicholson Baker&rsquo;s collection of essays &ldquo;The Way the World Works&rdquo; (Nov. 4) takes Baker to task for arguing that the United States was wrong to get involved militarily in World War II, and should instead have supported a lifesaving &ldquo;dignified peace&rdquo; with
In Peter Berg&rsquo;s whodunit &ldquo;The Kingdom,&rdquo; a young F.B.I. agent boarding a plane to Riyadh asks a seasoned colleague what Saudi Arabia is like. &ldquo;A bit like Mars,&rdquo; replies the more experienced man. It&rsquo;s not Mars, exactly, but for most Americans Saudi Arabia is probably more like another world than any other inhabited
To the Editor: From time to time, accounts of forecasting failures appear. Nate Silver&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;The Signal and the Noise,&rdquo; is one. It provides the excellent service of warning people that bad forecasts are common. Overlooked in Noam Scheiber&rsquo;s review (Nov. 4) is that bad forecasts are avoidable. Thanks to research over the
As the long election night began to take shape, all eyes remained fixed on the swing states. Some were on the Eastern Seaboard (Florida, Virginia), others in the West (Colorado, Nevada). In most cases the outcome hinged on the marshaling of dependable blocs of voters. But in the heartland &ldquo;battlegrounds&rdquo; &mdash; Ohio, Iowa,
Roberto Calasso is noted for being an intellectually challenging writer. He is supremely learned, wearing his gigantic erudition ostentatiously on both sleeves. He can prestidigitate with prestigious quotations from, and references to, everything from the Vedas to Hollywood. His new book to us (in &shy;Italy it is already penultimate) is &ldquo;La
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Not a Feeling,&rdquo; Dan Josefson&rsquo;s mordant, cockeyed first novel about a boarding school in upstate New York, includes, as many fantasy novels also do, a hand-drawn map of his invented world. Downhill from the gym, we see, is the ski-lodge-like cafetorium, which sits just behind the converted mansion used as an
That Alice Munro, now 81, is one of the great short story writers not just of our time but of any time ought to go without saying by now. This new volume &mdash; her 14th, not counting a collection of selected stories that came out in 1996 &mdash; is further proof of her mastery, and also a reminder that unlike a lot of accomplished short story
YO! ANGEL! Almost 20 years ago, in a New Yorker essay about the best-selling novels of the day, Anthony Lane made the unsurprising observation that popular taste and critical opinion don&rsquo;t often walk hand in hand. &ldquo;The editors of The Times Book Review would like to believe that they bring readers together beneath an umbrella of
Even if you didn&rsquo;t grow up making a beeline for the local emporium on New Comic Book Day &mdash; also known as Wednesday in most places &mdash; odds are Marvel Comics has entered your consciousness recently. This year alone, a film about one Marvel superhero team, &ldquo;The Avengers,&rdquo; smashed a box-office record and made more than $207
To the Editor: As a longtime fan of Kurt Vonnegut, I was offended by Kurt Andersen&rsquo;s remark, in his essay &ldquo;True to Character&rdquo; (Oct. 28), that Vonnegut had been &ldquo;dawdling for two decades on what he called his &lsquo;war book,&rsquo; publishing it at the height of the Vietnam War.&rdquo; To suggest that
A few years ago, while I was teaching a graduate seminar, the subject turned to blackface minstrelsy, one of America&rsquo;s first popular art forms. We were very likely in a discussion of the long poems of T. S. Eliot (&ldquo;The Waste Land&rdquo; had originally been called &ldquo;He Do the Police in Different Voices,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Sweeney
THOMAS JEFFERSON: The Art of Power , by Jon Meacham. (Random House, $35.) This readable and well-&shy;researched life celebrates Jefferson&rsquo;s skills as a practical politician, unafraid to wield power even when it conflicted with his small-government views. FLIGHT BEHAVIOR , by Barbara Kingsolver. (Harper/HarperCollins, $28.99.) An Appalachian
Peter May is a writer I&rsquo;d follow to the ends of the earth &mdash; which is where he takes us in THE BLACKHOUSE (Silver Oak, $24.95), the first novel in a projected trilogy featuring Detective Sergeant Finlay (Fin) Macleod of the Edinburgh police force. The setting is the windswept terrain of the Isle of Lewis, the northernmost of the Outer
This week, Kevin Young reviews Yuval Taylor and Jake Austen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Darkest America,&rdquo; a history of minstrelsy performed by African-Americans. Young, the author of seven books of poetry, also writes nonfiction, and in &ldquo;The Grey Album&rdquo; he examines the centrality of African-American culture to American culture. &ldquo;I use
Ever wonder what it would be like to be in the rehearsal room when actors are digging ferociously into their psyches to discover a moment of revelation, or arguing heatedly over a character&rsquo;s motivation? Your curiosity can be amply satisfied at Soho Rep , where an inventive new play by Jackie Sibblies Drury wedges the audience between the
Literary academics and rabid aficionados in search of fresh revelations might want to steer clear of &ldquo;Donka: A Letter to Chekhov,&rdquo; the whimsical, circus-style theatrical curio installed at the Harvey Theaer at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this weekend. Somewhere in the international mail system, the firm connection between that
All across the country, members of Team Edward and Team Jacob &mdash; not to mention Team Bella and Team Renesmee &mdash; were squaring off, as the final installment of the &ldquo;Twilight&rdquo; film series had its premiere on Thursday evening. &ldquo; The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn &ndash; Part 2 ,&rdquo; the fifth film in the adaptation of
Connie Wald , a Beverly Hills hostess whose dinner parties began during Hollywood&rsquo;s Golden Age and became an enduring social institution &mdash; part home-cooked casual, part parade of stars &mdash; died at her home on Nov. 10. She was 96. Her death was confirmed this week by her son Andrew. Ms. Wald had no need to drop names. They fell all
Besides being an achievement on its own terms, the fresh production of Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cos&igrave; Fan Tutte&rdquo; that opened at the Juilliard School on Wednesday night is a demonstration of how constituent organizations at Lincoln Center can work together effectively. This was the third collaboration between Juilliard, through its
In the old days it must have been a common sight: a bard with a fiddle, singing and playing at the same time. Medieval woodcuts often show a fiddler holding his instrument to his chest, a posture that frees up the throat for song. Singing fiddlers still appear sometimes in the back room of an Irish pub, or at a gathering of Gypsy musicians, where
The 13th annual Latin Grammy Awards on Thursday night anointed a new favorite for the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences: Jesse &amp; Joy , Mexican siblings whose heartbroken ballad &ldquo;&iexcl;Corre!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Run!&rdquo;) was named song of the year (an award for the songwriters) and record of the year (for the recorded single),
You have got to love a star who jovially admits to the kind of vulnerability that Peter Gallagher describes in his one-man show, &ldquo;How&rsquo;d All You People Get in My Room?&rdquo; at Feinstein&rsquo;s at Loews Regency. In his audition for the 1977 Broadway revival of &ldquo;Hair,&rdquo; he recalled on Tuesday evening, he began singing the
Bernard Lansky , a Memphis haberdasher who dressed the royalty of rhythm and blues, including the King, Elvis Presley , died on Thursday at his home in Memphis. He was 85. The cause was Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, his granddaughter, Julie Lansky, said. As the story goes, Presley was a teenager, working as an usher at a movie theater, when Mr. Lansky
Brahms has long been a specialty of Kurt Masur , both during his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic from 1991 to 2002 and for a quarter-century at the Leipzig Gewandhaus and on recordings. In a return to the Philharmonic this fall he is taking part in a survey of Brahms&rsquo;s complete symphonies and concertos, which began on
In &ldquo;Classic Uggams,&rdquo; her bright, spunky new show at 54 Below, Leslie Uggams recalls what happened several years ago when she flubbed the lyrics to &ldquo;June Is Bustin&rsquo; Out All Over,&rdquo; a song she barely knew, during a live, televised outdoor performance in Washington, and was heard spouting nonsensical filler. The night
This year, as usual, the Barnard Project assembled a group of choreographers to create dances for students at both Barnard College and Columbia University. But there was a shift from previous seasons, and it was a happy one: the choreographers were all promising names. On Thursday evening at New York Live Arts, the Barnard Project, now in its
